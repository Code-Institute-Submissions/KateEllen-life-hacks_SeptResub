## Project Overview 

This site is designed for people who love life hacks, but hate waisting time. It has been designed to genuinely help people with daily tasks, and make their lives a little easier. 
This isn't five minute crafts. This is where you come when you want to cut out all the useless life hacks and find exactly what you need, when you need it.

  #### Image Links 

  - This section on the homepage allows users to navigate to the three content pages without having to scroll back up to the navigation. It also adds some fun imagery to indicate what page you will be navigating to. 
  - The images feature large buttons that stick with the colour theme helping users to see which section they will be going to.

 #### HTML & CSS Accordian/ "Mini Hacks"
 - The accrodian featured at the bottom of all the pages (excluding the homepage and form page) make a fun accessible way to show extra hacks that you don't need a video to explain. 
 - The accordian also tidies up the page and saves space. Preventing the pages from getting too cluttered looking.

- There would be a public vote held on the social media accounts to choose the winner.
